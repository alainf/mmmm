  "description": "amuel Martell Richards (born September 3, 1960) is a sociologist currently working at The Pennsylvania State University. His work focuses on race and ethnicity. He co-directs the World in Conversation Project, as well as teaches the largest race course in the country with 720 students per semester. As a professor he is well known on campus and his iconoclasm landed him in \"The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America,\" a book published by David Horowitz that critiques the dominance of liberal thinking in the academy--which is ironic given that he is a registered Libertarian. In addition, his TED talk (called a \"Radical Experiment in Empathy\") is the third most widely viewed TEDx talk in the world as of May 2011.<br>Sam Richards received his B.A. and M.A. degrees at the University of Toledo, both in sociology. He also received a Ph.D from Rutgers University in Sociology and the socioeconomic development of Latin America and Africa. Sam has traveled to a wide range of destinations such as Mexico, Spain, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Turkey, Central America, Kuwait, Qatar, Israel, Palestine, the Netherlands, Japan, France, Ireland, England, Poland and Czech Republic, and throughout the United States. He did his doctoral research while living in Ecuador, but is now a professor at The Pennsylvania State University.",
